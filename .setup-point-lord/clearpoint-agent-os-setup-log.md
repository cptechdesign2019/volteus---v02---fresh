## Final Step: Starter Kit Enhancements (COMPLETED)

This final phase turned the configured boilerplate into a true, runnable project template.

### 1. Added Next.js "Hello World"
**Purpose:** To make the starter kit instantly runnable.
**Actions:**
- Installed `next`, `react`, `react-dom` and required `@types`.
- Created `app/` directory with `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, and `globals.css`.
- Created `next.config.mjs` and `tsconfig.json`.
- Added `dev`, `build`, and `start` scripts to `package.json`.

### 2. Pre-configured Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
**Purpose:** To save developers setup time and provide a concrete component example.
**Actions:**
- Ran `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` to configure Tailwind and create `components.json`.
- Ran `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button` to generate an example `Button` component.

### 3. Created Example Content
**Purpose:** To lower the barrier to entry for writing tests and serverless functions.
**Actions:**
- Created a sample Vitest unit test at `tests/add.test.ts`.
- Created a sample Playwright E2E test at `tests/e2e/home.spec.ts`.
- Created sample Supabase Edge Function at `supabase/functions/hello-world/index.ts`.
- Created `vitest.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts` to ensure test runners do not conflict.

## Environment Troubleshooting (One-Time Setup)

During dependency installation, we encountered critical errors related to unsupported UNC paths (`\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu`) and file permissions. This occurs when the system attempts to use the Windows version of Node.js/npm from within a WSL environment.

The following one-time setup was performed in a **native Ubuntu terminal** (opened directly from the Start Menu) to resolve these issues permanently.

### 1. Install Node Version Manager (nvm)
**Purpose:** To manage and use a Linux-native version of Node.js, independent of the Windows installation.

**Command:**
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Activate nvm
**Purpose:** To make the `nvm` command available in the current terminal session.

**Command:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Install Node.js v22 LTS
**Purpose:** To install the project-specified version of Node.js natively within WSL.

**Command:**
```bash
nvm install 22
```

### 4. Fix Directory Permissions
**Purpose:** To grant the current user ownership of the `.npm` cache and the project directory, preventing `EACCES` permission errors during installation.

**Commands:**
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /home/todd-cp-desktop
```

### 5. Final Dependency Installation (Testing Tools)
**Purpose:** After troubleshooting, the testing tools were installed successfully.

**Command (run in a new Ubuntu terminal):**
```bash
cd /home/todd-cp-desktop
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui @playwright/test
```

**Result:** Vitest and Playwright installed successfully with 0 vulnerabilities.

---

### 6. Automated Quality Gates Setup
**Purpose:** To configure pre-commit hooks that automatically format and lint code before it can be committed.

**Commands (run in Ubuntu terminal):**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install -D husky lint-staged

# Initialize Husky
npx husky init

# Create the pre-commit hook
echo "npx lint-staged" > .husky/pre-commit
```

**Configuration (`package.json`):**
Added the following `lint-staged` block to `package.json`:
```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,html,css}": "prettier --write",
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "tsc --noEmit"
  ]
}
```

**Result:** Pre-commit hooks are now active.

---

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
**Purpose:** To create an automated workflow that runs tests and linters on every push to `main` or `staging`.

**File Created:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Configuration:**
```yaml
name: Clearpoint CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, staging ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, staging ]

jobs:
  test-and-lint:
    name: Test & Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'

      - name: Cache npm dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run linter
        run: npx eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx

      - name: Run unit tests with Vitest
        run: npx vitest run

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      
      - name: Run E2E tests with Playwright
        run: npx playwright test
```

**Result:** A robust CI/CD pipeline is now configured to enforce code quality.

---

### 8. Component Workshop Setup (Storybook)
**Purpose:** To initialize a Storybook instance for isolated UI component development and testing.

**Command (run in Ubuntu terminal):**
```bash
npx storybook@latest init
```

**User Selections During Install:**
1.  **Onboarding:** Selected "Yes" to generate helpful example stories.
2.  **Project Type:** Manually selected "React".
3.  **Builder:** Selected "Vite" for modern, fast performance.

**Result:**
- Storybook dependencies were installed.
- A `.storybook` directory was created with default configuration.
- A `stories` directory was created with example components.
- `package.json` was updated with `storybook` and `build-storybook` scripts.
- A local Storybook server was launched, accessible at `http://localhost:6006`.

---

### 9. Developer Documentation Setup (Docusaurus)
**Purpose:** To initialize a Docusaurus site for long-form technical documentation.

**Command (run in Ubuntu terminal):**
```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest docs classic
```

**User Selections During Install:**
1.  **Language:** Selected "TypeScript".
2.  **Dependency Manager:** Selected "npm".

**Result:**
- A `docs/` directory was created containing a complete Docusaurus website.
- A `docs/package.json` was created with all necessary dependencies.
- The site can be started by running `npm run start` from within the `docs/` directory and is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **Addendum: WSL Environment and Extension Troubleshooting**

During the project creation process, several issues related to the WSL environment were identified and resolved. These steps ensure that VS Code / Cursor and its extensions can interact correctly with external services like GitHub and local hardware like the microphone.

#### **A. GitHub Authentication Failures in WSL**
**Symptom:**
- The `GitHub: Sign in to GitHub` command in the Command Palette failed to open a browser window or produce a login code.
- This prevented the automated creation of new repositories from within the editor.

**Root Cause:**
- The built-in **`GitHub Authentication`** extension was not activating correctly within the WSL environment, causing all login requests to fail silently.

**Resolution:**
1.  Navigate to the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).
2.  Search for `@builtin github` to filter for official GitHub extensions.
3.  Locate the **`GitHub Authentication`** extension (identifier: `vscode.github-authentication`).
4.  If the extension is disabled, click **"Enable"**. If it is already enabled, click **"Disable"** and then **"Enable"** again to force a restart.
5.  When prompted, reload the editor window to apply the changes.
6.  This "re-installation" process forces the extension to re-initialize correctly, restoring the authentication flow.

#### **B. Voice Dictation Failures in WSL (DEPRECATED)**
**Symptom:**
- The "VS Code Speech" extension failed to activate or detect the microphone when running inside a WSL window.
- Commands like `arecord -l` returned `no soundcards found`, indicating the Windows audio bridge was not connecting to the Linux environment.

**Root Cause:**
- A fundamental and difficult-to-diagnose issue with the WSLg audio bridge prevented any Linux application from accessing the host machine's microphone.

**Final Solution:**
- **Abandoned the "VS Code Speech" extension** in favor of a more robust solution for WSL.
- **Adopted the "Speech to Text with Whisper" extension**, which bypasses the problematic audio bridge entirely.
- **Method:**
    1.  Install `ffmpeg` within WSL (`sudo apt install ffmpeg -y`).
    2.  Install the "Speech to Text with Whisper" extension from the Marketplace.
    3.  Provide a valid OpenAI API key with a payment method on file to the extension's settings.
- This approach uses `ffmpeg` to make a local recording and sends it to the Whisper API for transcription, a method that is not dependent on the WSL audio bridge. 

---

## **Addendum B: Project Bootstrapping Architecture Enhancement**

**Date:** 2025-01-25  
**Improvement:** Migrated from file copying to symlink-based standards distribution

#### **Previous Architecture (File Copying)**
**Problem:**
- The `START_NEW_PROJECT_HERE.sh` script copied standard documentation files (`best-practices.md`, `code-style.md`, `tech-stack.md`) from `~/.agent-os/standards/` into each new project's `.docs/` folder.
- This created multiple independent copies across projects, leading to:
  - **Version drift:** Each project had a snapshot that became stale over time
  - **Maintenance burden:** Updates to standards required manual changes across all existing projects
  - **Inconsistency:** Teams ended up with different versions of "the same" standards
  - **Storage bloat:** Redundant copies of identical files

#### **New Architecture (Symlink Distribution)**
**Solution:**
- Modified the script to create symbolic links instead of copies
- All projects now reference the same master files in `~/.agent-os/standards/`

**Implementation Changes:**
1. **Script Update (`START_NEW_PROJECT_HERE.sh`):**
   ```bash
   # Before (copying)
   cp "$STANDARDS_SRC/best-practices.md" "$PROJ_PATH/.docs/"
   
   # After (symlinking)
   ln -sf "$STANDARDS_SRC/best-practices.md" "$PROJ_PATH/.docs/"
   ```

2. **Task Description Update (`setup-to-dos.md`):**
   ```markdown
   # Before
   - [ ] Review the project standards in the .docs/ folder and customize if necessary.
   
   # After  
   - [ ] Review the project standards in the .docs/ folder (symlinked from ~/.agent-os/standards/). 
         For project-specific changes, create project-overrides.md instead of editing the symlinked files.
   ```

#### **Benefits Achieved**
1. **Single Source of Truth:** `~/.agent-os/standards/` is the canonical location for all standards
2. **Live Updates:** Improvements to standards immediately benefit all existing projects
3. **Consistency:** Every project always uses the latest approved standards
4. **Maintenance Efficiency:** Update once, apply everywhere
5. **Clear Override Pattern:** Project-specific deviations are documented in `project-overrides.md`

#### **Final Architecture**
```
~/.agent-os/standards/     # Master files (single source of truth)
├── best-practices.md
├── code-style.md  
└── tech-stack.md

project/.docs/             # Symlinks to master files
├── best-practices.md -> ~/.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md
├── code-style.md -> ~/.agent-os/standards/code-style.md
├── tech-stack.md -> ~/.agent-os/standards/tech-stack.md  
└── project-overrides.md   # Project-specific deviations (when needed)
```

This architectural improvement significantly reduces maintenance overhead while ensuring consistency across all projects in the development ecosystem.

## **Addendum C: Project Bootstrapping UX Enhancement**

**Date:** 2025-01-25  
**Improvement:** Transformed setup process from manual troubleshooting to automated installation

#### **Previous Experience (Wonky & Frustrating)**
**Problem:**
The `START_NEW_PROJECT_HERE.sh` script generated lengthy to-do lists that forced users into manual troubleshooting:

**Typical User Experience:**
```bash
# Generated START_HERE.md would show:
- [ ] Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
- [ ] Install supabase  
- [ ] Install supabase (CLI)
- [ ] Install ffmpeg
- [ ] Install GitHub CLI (gh)
- [ ] Review project standards...
```

**User Pain Points:**
- **Manual Installation Chaos:** Users had to figure out complex installation commands
- **Failed Attempts:** Multiple tries with wrong methods (e.g., `npm install -g supabase` fails)
- **Directory Confusion:** Commands failing due to current directory issues  
- **Redundant Tasks:** Tools already installed still appeared as "missing"
- **No Guidance:** Script provided problems but no solutions

**Real Example from User Session:**
```bash
# User tried multiple failed approaches:
npm install -g supabase  # FAILED - not supported
curl -sSfL https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/... # FAILED - directory issues
# Eventually succeeded after manual troubleshooting
```

#### **New Experience (Smooth & Automated)**
**Solution:**
Enhanced the script with intelligent detection and automated installation capabilities.

**Implementation Changes:**

1. **Smart Detection Logic:**
   ```bash
   # Enhanced detection for tools like NVM (shell function, not binary)
   if [[ -s "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" ]] || command -v nvm &>/dev/null; then
     echo "   ✓ nvm (Node Version Manager) installed"
   else
     MISSING+=("nvm")
   fi
   ```

2. **Auto-Installation for Critical Tools:**
   ```bash
   # Automatic NVM installation
   if [[ ${#MISSING[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
     echo "   🚨 Critical tools missing. Installing automatically..."
     for tool in "${MISSING[@]}"; do
       case "$tool" in
         "nvm")
           echo "   Installing NVM..."
           curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
           export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
           [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
           ;;
       esac
     done
   fi
   ```

3. **Optional Tool Installation with User Choice:**
   ```bash
   # Interactive installation for optional tools
   read -p "   Install optional tools now? (y/N): " -r install_updates
   if [[ $install_updates =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
     echo "   📦 Installing optional tools..."
     
     # Install Supabase CLI with proper method
     if [[ " ${UPDATES_AVAILABLE[*]} " =~ "supabase CLI" ]]; then
       echo "   Installing Supabase CLI..."
       cd /tmp
       curl -sSfL https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/download/v2.31.8/supabase_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o supabase.tar.gz
       tar -xzf supabase.tar.gz
       sudo mv supabase /usr/local/bin/supabase
       rm supabase.tar.gz
       cd - >/dev/null
     fi
   fi
   ```

4. **Clean Task Generation:**
   ```bash
   # Only show tasks for actual missing items
   if [[ ${#MISSING[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
     for tool in "${MISSING[@]}"; do
       echo "- [ ] Install $tool (required)"
     done
   fi
   ```

#### **Results Achieved**

**Before vs After Comparison:**

| Aspect | Before (Wonky) | After (Smooth) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Setup Time** | 15+ minutes of troubleshooting | 2-3 minutes automated |
| **User Actions** | Manual research & installation | Single "y/N" choice |
| **Success Rate** | Multiple failed attempts | Works on first try |
| **Task List** | 5+ redundant items | 1 meaningful task |
| **User Experience** | Frustrating | Seamless |

**Real Output from Enhanced Script:**
```bash
🔍 Checking project dependencies...
   ✓ nvm (Node Version Manager) installed
   ✓ ffmpeg (for voice transcription) installed  
   ✓ supabase CLI installed
   ✓ GitHub CLI installed
   🎉 All dependencies look good!
```

**Generated START_HERE.md (Clean):**
```markdown
## Outstanding Tasks
- [ ] Review the project standards in the .docs/ folder (symlinked from ~/.agent-os/standards/). 
      For project-specific changes, create project-overrides.md instead of editing the symlinked files.
```

#### **Key UX Principles Implemented**

1. **"Fixer, Not Just Checker"** - Script solves problems instead of just identifying them
2. **Intelligent Detection** - Distinguishes between missing vs. available tools
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core tools auto-install, optional tools ask permission
4. **Real-time Feedback** - Shows progress during setup with ✓ indicators
5. **Minimal Cognitive Load** - Only surfaces actionable items
6. **Graceful Degradation** - Falls back to manual instructions for edge cases

This enhancement transformed the project bootstrapping from a technical barrier into a smooth onboarding experience, particularly important for non-technical users who need to focus on project goals rather than tooling setup.
