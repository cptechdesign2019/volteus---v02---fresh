## 2025-07-29: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Todd Church, Aaron Zink

### Decision

The project will proceed based on the vision, features, and roadmap defined in the initial PRD and the generated Agent OS product documents (`mission.md`, `roadmap.md`). The core focus is on delivering a functional quoting engine and product library as the primary MVP.

### Context

This decision was made at the outset of the `volteus-v02-fresh` project, following a thorough analysis of the legacy application and a strategic pivot to a "Describe & Re-Design" methodology. The goal is to build a clean, modern, and scalable platform that directly addresses the pain points of the existing workflow.

### Alternatives Considered

1.  **Direct Migration of Legacy Code**
    *   **Pros**: Potentially faster initial setup.
    *   **Cons**: High risk of inheriting technical debt, dependency issues, and architectural problems (as demonstrated in the `volteus-v01` attempt). Rejected due to persistent failures.

### Rationale

The "Describe & Re-Design" approach, guided by the Agent OS framework, was chosen to ensure a stable, maintainable, and scalable foundation. By clearly defining the product in documentation first, we enable the AI agent to build features correctly from the ground up, avoiding the trial-and-error that plagued previous efforts.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- A clear, documented plan for the AI to follow.
- A stable foundation based on a clean starter kit.
- Prioritization of the most critical business features.

**Negative:**
- Requires more upfront documentation and planning compared to a direct coding approach.
