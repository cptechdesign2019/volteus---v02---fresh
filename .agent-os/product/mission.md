## Pitch

Volteus is a bespoke, all-in-one business-operations platform that helps the Clearpoint team manage the entire client lifecycle by replacing disparate tools and streamlining the quoting process.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Clearpoint Team**: The internal users responsible for sales, project management, and technical installation.

### User Personas

**Project Manager / Sales**
- **Role:** Handles client interaction from lead to project completion.
- **Context:** Juggles multiple tools for quoting, project tracking, and customer communication.
- **Pain Points:** Wasted time switching between applications, complex multi-option quoting process.
- **Goals:** Streamline the quoting process, have a single source of truth for project status.

**Technician**
- **Role:** Field installer responsible for executing project plans.
- **Context:** Needs clear, mobile-friendly access to project details while on-site.
- **Pain Points:** Lack of real-time updates, cumbersome daily reporting.
- **Goals:** Quickly access project information, easily report progress.

## The Problem

### Fragmented Toolchain

Managing a client project currently requires multiple, disconnected applications. This leads to data silos, wasted time, and unnecessary subscription costs.

**Our Solution:** Volteus will unify these functions into a single, cohesive platform.

### Inefficient Quoting Process

The current method for creating multi-option quotes is complex and time-consuming.

**Our Solution:** The platform will feature a guided quoting engine, prioritized for immediate development, to create detailed proposals efficiently.

## Differentiators

### Bespoke Workflow Integration

Unlike off-the-shelf products, Volteus is designed specifically for Clearpoint's end-to-end client lifecycle, resulting in a highly efficient, tailored workflow.

### All-in-One Platform

By integrating quoting, project management, and technician field-logging, we eliminate the need for multiple subscriptions and create a single source of truth for all project data.

## Key Features (MVP Priority)

### Core MVP

- **Functional Quoting Engine:** A guided workflow for creating proposals. This is the highest priority.
- **Product Library:** A fully functional and searchable database of all equipment. This is required for the quoting engine.
- **Leads & Customer Management:** A simple CRM to track the sales funnel. Includes both manual and automatic conversion of a lead to a customer upon quote acceptance.

### Post-MVP

- **AI-Assisted Scope of Work:** A feature to generate a scope of work based on user input and the product list.
- **Project Management Dashboard:** A centralized view of all projects and their status.
- **Technician Mobile View:** A simplified interface for technicians in the field.
