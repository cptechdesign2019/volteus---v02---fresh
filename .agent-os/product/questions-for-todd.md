1.  **"Multi-option tabs"**: Does this mean a single quote can have, for example, a "Good," "Better," and "Best" set of equipment options that the client can toggle between?
2.  **"Live cost/profit"**: Is this calculated based on `Dealer Cost` vs. `MSRP` from the Product Library, or is there a more complex margin/markup rule we need to account for?
